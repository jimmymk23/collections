    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a sophomore at IU studying Interactive and Digital Media. I love how this specialization is the intersection between creativity with the arts as well as many more conventional math practices such as coding.</p>
    <p>I grew up in New Jersey, usually spend my summers in Cape Cod working for my family hotel, and love spending my days off at the beach. Making the decision to go to college away from home was a hard one for me because I've lived my entire life in NJ, but I knew that getting the experience of living somewhere else would be a positive one for me and something that I still don't regret.</p>
    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>Some of my favorite artists right now are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Jon Bellion</li>
      <li>The 1975</li>
      <li>Imagine Drragons</li>
      <li>B&#216;RNS</li>
      <li>Panic! At the Disco</li>
      <li>Twenty One Pilots</li>
      <li>AJR</li>
      <li>and many more...</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Quote</h2>
    <p>This quote is one of my favorites, and also happens to be a very famous one:</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.keepinspiring.me/famous-quotes/">
      “Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn’t do than by the ones you did do.”
      -Mark Twain
