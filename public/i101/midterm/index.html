                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is James Keseling, but I go by Jimmy. I grew up in New Jersey and am currently studying at Indiana University for Interactive & Digital Media. I usually spend my summers in Cape Cod working for my family hotel and love spending my days off at the beach. Making the decision to go to college away from home was a hard one for me because I've lived my entire life in NJ, but I knew that getting the experience of living somewhere else would be a positive experience for me and something that I still don't regret.</p>
