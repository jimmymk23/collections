    <center><h1> Introduction to Problem</h1></center>

    <center><p> <b> Scenario: </b> A new food truck has just opened in town and the <br />
    owner is looking for a way to stay connected <br />
    with their growing customer base as well as engage new customers. <br />
    The owners are not up-to-date on technology trends and has <br />
      two other employees besides themselves. </p></center>


  <center><p> Allowing consumers to access food trucks in a more efficient and simple way. </p></center>

  <center><h1> Process </h1></center>

  <center> <img src ="images/group.jpg" width= "350"> </center>

  <center> <p> The process our team took was to do research and conduct interviews that related to our problem and scenario. This included interviewing people and asking them their
    personal experiences with food trucks and how our solution could potentially make it better. We also as a group discussed what techonolgy platform would lead to our solution which
    will be discussed on other pages of the site. Another aspect that helped was out group talking about our own experiences with food trucks and restaurants on Kirkwood because alot of
    them have apps or online ordering as well. </p> </center>

  <center><h1> Basic Information </h1></center>
  <center> <p> The problem for most consumers is not bring able to locate the food truck in order to get food.
    Also, people usually do not have access to food truck hours and menus until you go on site to the location.
    Therefore, throughout the website we have provided information that led us to develop our solution. This problem affects people all across America. Especially those on college campuses that do not even know about the food trucks near them. One of the major problems college students at IU have with food trucks is not being able to find it and not having enough time to order between classes.  </p>
