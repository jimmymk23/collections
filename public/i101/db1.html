        <ul>
            <p>What are primary keys?</p>
            <li><i>They are some unique identifier for each row.</i></li>
            <br />
            <p>What are foreign keys?</p>
            <li><i>They still uniquely identify each row, but they originated from a different table.</i></li>
            <br />
            <p>What is the difference between a tuple and an attribute?</p>
            <li><i>Tuples are entire rows of data. Attributes are the name of each column and describe what is in it.</i></li>
            <br />
            <p>What is SQL? (What does it stand for and what does it do?)</p>
            <li><i>It stands for "Structured Query Language" and is great for grouping short lines of code together to organize raw data into tables.</i></li>
            <br />
            <p>Provide an example of something that could be used as a primary key and explain why you chose that.</p>
            <li><i>A fingerprint could be considered a primary key because it is unique to every person and can be used to differentiate people.</i></li>
        </ul>
