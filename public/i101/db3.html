            <p>What are the common types of problems with data?</p>
            <li><i>Typical data problems are data that has been inputed incorrectly, duplicates, or missing data.</i></li>
            <br />
            <p>What was the hardest type of data problem to clean for you?</p>
            <li><i>The hardest cleaning problem for me would probably be correcting inaccurate data becuase you would need to fix each problem individually (that I know of) and that would take a lot more time that the other problems I've encountered so far. </i></li>
            <br />
            <p>How comfortable do you feel about cleaning data sets?</p>
            <li><i>About a 4. I feel comfortable with what we've practiced in class and feel like I can do it on my own for the most part, but may encounter some problems that stump me.</i></li>
        </ul>
