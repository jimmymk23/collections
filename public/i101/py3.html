        <h2>What is the correct syntax for a while loop?</h2>
            <p><i>"While Loops"</i> are great for repeating a series of code that will continue as long as a certain criteria is met. For example, <i>while number = 5:</i>, "number = 5" being the criteria that needs to be met for the loop to work. The code that is directly below it and indented will be carried out as long as the <i>number</i> is still <i>5</i>.</p>

        <h2>What is a good use of remove in a program?</h2>
            <p>A good use for "remove" in a program is when you have a list and want to randomly select items from that list. Using "remove" will make sure that the items already selected cannot be selected again.</p>
