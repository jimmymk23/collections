    <p> Restaurants always need more ways to attract more customers to their locations. Most ways restaurants do this is by offering daily specials. Recently there has been more attention towards apps that have rewards programs and online ordering implemented within them. For our problem being that a food truck is having trouble connecting with their growing customer base, we think using an app would be the best solution. The main problem for restaurants is being able to connect with its consumers. Therefore, apps are an efficient way for consumers to interact with their favorite restaurants. </p>
    <p> Lauren Johnson’s article discusses how fast food restaurants are changing the way they serve to customers using digital platforms like apps. Some of the topics discussed are how online ordering has increased sales and the implementation of loyalty programs within an app. Since most people like to order online, apps have shown that there is a 26% increase in sales than in comparison to someone who places an order in store. The article also uses Chipotle as an example because they recently started using online ordering to cut down on lines and wait time for consumers (“Fast-Food Brands Are Making Slick Mobile Apps to Stay Ahead of Small, Fast-Casual Restaurants”). </p>
    <p> The article is important because it shows how successful fast food industries are with the development of apps. It is very easy to relate to this because we use a lot of the apps that fast food industries are using like Chipotle, ClusterTruck and Potbelly. Apps allow users to interact more efficiently with their favorite restaurants. There is also a lot of different features a developer can design for the app like location tracker, points system, offers, and order online. The article pertains to our problem space because the scenario involves a food truck company looking to stay connected with their growing customer base. An app would be an efficient solution for this even though the owners do not know the technology trends. This can be solved through feedback because any changes that are to be made in the app can be requested by customers. Some beginning features in the app could include a location tracker to see where the truck is stationed during open hours and a rewards system to grow closer to the customers, which would also satisfy them with offers!	</p>

  <h2> Secondary Research Source 2 </h2> 
    <p>The first, and easiest, way to keep your customers informed is to post a schedule on your website. This will be great for people who see where you are going to be tomorrow, the next week, and possibly the next month depending on how extensive the planning is. Though sometimes, events occur that are out of our control, such as weather, road construction, or even a breakdown that can delay or completely hinder our previously set schedule. One remedy to fix the rigid schedule problem is to embed a Google Calendar into your website. This will allow the owner to simply open the google calendar app on their phone, make a few location changes to their schedule, and hit done; the updating happens all behind the scenes, making your changes live instantly on your website and to the public.</p>
<p>According to FoodTruckr, one way to take the location updating aspect up a level is to link it to a GPS directly from the truck. This can be done fairly easily by purchasing a GPS tracking device, such as Geo-Trax for example, and installing it to a device with an internet connection. A device like this can keep a log of your frequent locations on the manufacturer’s servers and share that information with you, allowing you to create a feed of your current location on your website. This would be the most efficient and convenient way for your customers to stay up-to-date with your location in case you are running late or made a last-minute change to your schedule. Users would also be able to see the status of the truck, such as “traveling”, “set up”, and/or other customizable messages to let users know if the truck is currently moving or not, so they can wait until the truck arrives at its destination.</p>

 <p> Kugler’s article focuses on the social impact that apps have on our generation. The article touches on the apps of the first generation like Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook that were created as social media platforms for the millenials. However, the article goes further into depth on how apps today are built to have a social impact that does good for poverty. Apps like Feedie donates a meal to non-profit organizations if users share pictures of their meals at partnering restaurants. Kugler states, “Information spreads much faster now, and can create awareness around problems that affect our people and planet." This is important because an app for a food truck has the ability to reach a lot of consumers. The app for our solution could not only be beneficial for the users but also for the town. If there is a simple feature, for example, if a consumer posts a picture of their food from the food truck the food truck will donate $1 to a local charity. </p>

  <h2> Academic Source </h2>
 <p> Kolisetty’s article focuses on app development for restaurant managers in India. The app Zomato allows people in India to place online orders for delivery at multiple restaurants. If I had to compare this to a similar app in bloomington it would be like Btown menus. This article was useful for our solution because the food truck managers only have two people operating the truck. Therefore, there would be problems if we had a delivery feature on the app because there would be no one to deliver. After reading this, we knew that if we had an online delivery feature it could only be for pickup. Having an order for pickup may not be as convenient for the customer, but it does let them skip the lines during peak hours. The article touches on all of the user experience problems and the developers of the apps attempt to redesign the app for a better experience. As a whole, the article addressed many of the problems that a user of an app would experience and their solutions to fixing the problems. </p>

<h2> Survey Results </h2>
  <p> Quick survey for information related to how people order their food. Either calling for carry out, call to deliver, on site, or through an app. </p>
<img src ="images/survey.jpg" width= "550"> 

<p> Based on the results, most people used an app to order their food. Either secondary delivery apps or the actual restaurants app. Therefore, we thought it was beneficial to have an app for our food truck because food trucks can't deliver our app will only be call to pickup. This reduced the consumers wait time especially if they are on a time crunch. </p>

  <h2> Documentation </h2>

<p> As a whole, our group was able to work well together and create a solution that was effcient for our prblem. There are many things that went well. Our group was good at communicating with each other and making sure assignments were done by the due date. We also were able to collectively collaberate on the website and help each other when there was trouble. 
</p>
<p> There are things that could have been approved upon as well. Our group saw that it would have been more helpful if we had defined roles that each person could focus on. This made it important so that one person was not doing more work than the rest. Still, our group did a fantastic job splitting up the amounts of work. </p>
