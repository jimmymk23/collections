        <h1>Python 1</h1>

        <h2>Python Programming Terms:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Function</b> - Something that carries out a command or task. For example, "print" will <i>print</i> whatever it is supposed to.</li>
                <li><b>Argument</b> - Something that is being carried out by the function. For example, 6*217 is the argument and will be calculated with the function <i>print</i>. This is also easy to spot because it will always be inside the function's parenthesis.</li>
                <li><b>String</b> - Basically anything that placed within quotation marks is recognized as a string.</li>
                <li><b>Variable</b> - Can be anything that points or referrs to something else. For example, word1="supercalifragalisticexpialadocious", where I am now able to just type <i>word1</i> instead of whatever you've it set to.</li>
                <li><b>Integer</b> - A number, as long as it doesn't have a decimal... that's called a "float".</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Why is it important to keep track of data types?</h2>
            <p>This is important because once programs start getting larger and more complex, it may become confusing and more difficult to recall what was a string, what was a variable, what was an integer, etc.</p>
