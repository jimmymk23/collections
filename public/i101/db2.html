        <ul>
            <p>What is the primary key for the "students" table?</p>
            <li><i>The primary key for the "students" table is id.</i></li>
            <br />
            <p>What are the two foreign keys for the "takes_course" table?</p>
            <li><i>The two foreign keys are "id" from the students table and "classid" from the courses table.</i></li>
            <br />
            <p>How are the primary and foreign keys related in the tables?</p>
            <li><i>The primary and foreign keys are related in the tables becuase they represent unique information in the tables in which they are primary keys, but in the tables in which they are forign keys, they represent a relationship between the two. For example, an id of "1234" from the students table and a classid of "9876" from the courses table represent their respective information, but in a table such as takes-courses, the id and classid are now foreign keys and are able to show us that a student with an id of "1234" is taking a course with an id of "9876".</i></li>
            <br />
            <p>What is the schema of the "courses" table?</p>
            <li><i>The courses table has a schema of "classid", "name", "course_num", and "cred_hours".</i></li>
            <br />
        </ul>
